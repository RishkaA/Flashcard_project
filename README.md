# Flashcard_project
This is a python project which uses Tkinter module for a flashcard language learning.

French words are saved to csv file and are displayed to the user. in 3 seconds the card flips and displays an English translation.

User then has a choise: to click a green tick button, meaning they already know the word and don't want to see it again. The word is then deleted, the file is updated and the next word is displayed to the user.

User can also click a red cross button, which will just go to the next word randomly picked from the file.
